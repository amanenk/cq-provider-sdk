CloudQuery Provider SDK
=======================

This SDK enables building CloudQuery providers which allows CloudQuery's users to extract/load/transform existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions into a SQL or Graph Database.

CloudQuery itself is a tool that transforms your cloud infrastructure into queryable SQL or Graphs for easy monitoring, governance and security. You can find more about CloudQuery on its website and its GitHub repository.
